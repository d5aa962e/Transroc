This directory contains the 3D files needed to print the plastic parts.  

The Top_Mount, Bottom_Mount, Battery_Holder, and Thumb_Mount correspond to the parts of the same name as shown in Figure 4 of the TRANSROC Owner's Manual

The Battery_Carrier-504 and Battery_Carrier-A23 files are used if you wish to build a simulated "authentic" Eveready 504 battery.  See the Battery section of the manual for more information on the various batteries.
