### A Recreation of the 1970s Estes Model Rocket Transmitter

The TRANSROC is a model rocket telemetry accessory designed by Estes Industries in the early 1970s.  The TRANSROC transmitted in the 27MHz Citizen Band frequency range, and could be built in several configurations, each designed to relay data from variouis types of sensors.

This project is a functional, historically accurate recreation of the original transmitter, designed from photos of actual TRANSROCs, as well as from measurements and data from the original manual.

The TRANSROC described here is the "B" Configuration model.  The "B" version was an improved version distributed by Estes after the first 1000 kits were manufactured.  These improvements made the kit easier to build, and simplified the installing the varioius telemetry modules.

Most of the manuals can be found on [transroc.org](https://transroc.org).  The "B" Configuration manual can be found [here](Manuals_and_Datasheets)).
