# Parts List

While most parts can be ordered online, the hardest items to find are the iron core slugs.  Only one manufacturer was found, and so a bulk order was placed.  

A large portion of the total is from shipping costs.  To help lower the shipping, I have a limitted quantity of the following parts to offer up at cost.  Please contact me for more information.

	Powdered Iron coil slug, 1/4" dia x 1/2" long (Antenna)
	Powdered Iron coil slug, 3/16" dia x 5/16" long (Oscillator)
	Evergreen Tube 9/32" (enough for two coil forms)
	Evergreen Tube 1/4" (enough for two coil forms)
	Blank PC Board
	Brass strips (enough for three contacts)
	Transistor, 2N5138 PNP
	Transistor, 2N5172 NPN
	Transistor, 2N6027 PUJT

#### Notes

1. These parts can be ordered from most electronics suppliers.  If a part is substituted, make sure the new part physically fits in the alloted space.
2. This resistor is only needed for testing, and not needed if you have a current limitted power supply.
3. These parts are hard to find in their original package, but not impossible.
4. These are the lengths given in the Owner's Manual.  
5. The battery contacts are made from 0.01" Brass Strips. 
6. The board with coils must be built from scratch.
7. These parts are printed on a 3D printer.
8. I have a limitted supply of these slugs. Please contact me for more information.
9. Select a crystal that matches the channel for your walkie-talkie.  Typically Channel 11 or 14 are used.  You must purchase the crystal on your own.  Ebay seems to be a good source.  The price listed is approximate.
