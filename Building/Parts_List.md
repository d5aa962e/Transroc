#### Notes

1. These parts can be ordered from most electronics suppliers.  If a part is substituted, make sure the new part physically fits in the alloted space.
2. This resistor is only needed for testing, and not needed if you have a current limitted power supply.
3. These parts are hard to find in their original package, but not impossible.
4. These are the lengths given in the Owner's Manual.  
5. The battery contacts are made from 0.01" Brass Strips. 
6. The board with coils must be built from scratch.
7. These parts are printed on a 3D printer.
8. I have a limitted supply of these slugs. Please contact me for more information.
9. Select a crystal that matches the channel for your walkie-talkie.  Typically Channel 11 or 14 are used.
10. Please see the Build Instruction for information on these parts.
