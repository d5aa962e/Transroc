# Next Steps

Where can we go from here?  The possibilities are almost endless.

- A power switch could be added to the bottom of the battery holder.  This would eliminate the need to constantly insert and remove the battery, and would minimize the wear on the battery contacts.
- "Daughter Boards" - There was talk that an incarnation of the TRANSROC existed which had pluggable boards (Post #24 of [this](https://oldrocketforum.com/showthread.php?t=19183&page=3&pp=10) thread).  Attempting something similar would be a nice improvement to the original.
- The wheels were spinning as early as the [first](https://www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/the-transroc-cloning-a-1970s-model-rocket-27mhz-telemetry-transmitter/) post for this project.  Future plans were mentioned at the end of the post -- "...look a what's out there and see how many sensors and transmitters (think camera, WiFi, audio, GPS, etc.) can fit into the same volume.  THAT should be a fun project!"  Need I say more? ;-)
